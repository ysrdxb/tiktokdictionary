tiktokdictionary.com 
Aim: 
To make a site with the same purpose and functionality as Urban Dictionary, but better! You need to think about what features to add which would make the tiktok dictionary better, and add them to your design. 
Tiktokdictionary.com is a user-powered dictionary, similar to Urbandictionary.com - but more suited towards tiktokers and social media creators.
The aim of tiktokdictionary.com is to be a non-sponsored, 100% organic source of new words and topics that originate from social media and niche communities like tiktok and forums. .
It works by allowing users to submit a word they saw on social media, then other users ‘agree / disagree’ with the definitions written by the user who submitted.
Similar to urban dictionaries, other users will be able to provide alternate definitions to the same words. Other users will also be able to agree / disagree with these definitions. The UI will need to present the most ‘agreed’ definition as a priority to the user rather than the definitions with lesser ‘agrees’ and more ‘disagrees’
Words that have high contributions and agree / disagree should rank higher on the homepage, which other users can sort based on timeframe (trending now, this week, this month etc….)

Budget:
Not known yet

Fundamental / core functionality (how the site will look / work):
The ultimate goal, as mentioned above, is to have a simple site where users can submit word definitions, and other users can easily navigate those submitted definitions, similar to an urban dictionary.

That’s it! 

When designing the UI / Functionality, think about the sort of problems that users would face, given that the platform content is produced by the users themselves. Make sure to design the site in a way where we can work around such issues. For example, how will we handle many user submissions of the same word?

Essential Requiremtns: 
The layout and UI of the site must be completely new and unique. Don’t copy existing sites like urbandictionary. Come up with creative new features that existing dictionary sites don’t have.
I have only provided the fundamental idea behind the site. You will need to get creative and come up with unique features that make the platform even better than current competitors. Think outside of the box to address issues that future users may come across. 


Initial Probationary Milestone:
This is the budget, deadline and deliverables  we’re setting aside for the initial phase of the project, so that we can ‘test the waters’ with you first before long-term commitment. Think of this as a trial period. If the agreed work can’t be completed within this budget, we’ll need to end the partnership. 
Amount: $400 AUD
Deadline: 2nd Oct 2025
Deliverables: UI complete for the homepage + idea on how the backend will work. 
Hard parts of this project / What we’re looking for in the delivery of the initial milestone
Un-conventional UI and layout design - this is important! Think outside of the box to design a unique, one of a kind UI that is not currently seen on existing software that has similar purpose / functionality.
Creative copy where needed - ability to write unique copy without the assistance of ChatGPT. 
Fast and clean delivery
Working backend concept (does not yet need to be built) for the trend discovery system itself.



Home
The Home Page is the central hub where users can explore all submitted dictionary words / jargon and add new ones.
It must feel community-driven, intuitive, and visually engaging, like a mix between Exploding Topics and a social discovery board.
Let users:
Browse words submitted by others
Sort words (by popularity, timeframe, or niche)
Submit their own new word directly from the same page
Search for a word using the search bar at the top
Filter words based on trends and ‘soon to be trends’ 

Requirements:
From this home page, it should also be extremely easy for the user to submit a new word.
Above the fold, put the search bar where the user can search for a word. See the user flow here to understand what happens if the word is on the site already or not.

The TikTok Dictionary - Learn And Submit New Words You Hear On Tiktok & Other Platforms

New words are being created and used every day by niche communities both online and in real life. The goal of TikTokDictionary is to be the go-to dictionary for neologisms - updating every second by the community. 

How it works
Submit a new word you come across on social media, along with its definition and where you first saw it
Submit alternate / improved definitions
Agree / disagree with definitions submitted by other users.


Word / Item
Each definition shown on the site’s homepage should display the following fields inside its card/div block:
1. Word Title
Large and bold — the main clickable text.
Clicking should open the trend’s detail page.

2. -  Live view counter + ‘trending indicator’ - if the word has many views, write ‘possible polar trend’ somewhere next to the live view counter. Indicate that it is live with a green dot animation. 

3. Description
Short summary of what the word is about.
Keep text truncation (e.g., max 2–3 lines) with “Read more” expansion.

4. Agree button 
This is the button the users click when they agree the word definition / if it is correct. You also need to include a popularity indicator to show words that have a high amount of likes over a period of time. 

5. Category
Example categories: Tech, Fashion, Slang, Product, Meme, etc.
Shown as a small colored tag or pill near the top or bottom of the card.

6. Domain name availability
The purpose of this section is to show the user whether the domain name for the particular word is available for purchase or not. This is how the site will be monetised. 
Copy for this section:
Get the ‘Word here’ Domain Name For Your Business
Using a short, single-word domain name for your brand comes with major advantages, such as:
Built-in traffic: Real words often match high-volume search terms, helping your site attract organic visitors more easily via SEO.


Instant credibility: A clean, dictionary-style domain makes your brand look established, trustworthy, and memorable.


Stronger branding: One-word domains are simple to remember, easy to share, and stand out across social media and ads.


Long-term value: These domains are digital assets that can appreciate in value over time — many sell for thousands or even millions.


Is this really a good financial decision? Before deciding to buy this domain, research it properly using third party tools like Semrush, EarlyAdoption, or any other reliable traffic analysis software. 

AFFILIATE DISCLAIMER - IMPORTANT:
Tiktok dictionary remains completely FREE to use and free of any banner advertising thanks to referral commissions from Godaddy. 
This means we will receive a small commission from godaddy if you decide to purchase any domain name from their platform. 
That being said, we never exaggerate or manipulate traffic data just to encourage a purchase through GoDaddy. Please make sure to do your own research about the word using Semrush, EarlyAdoption or other third party traffic checking tools, to help you decide whether or not the domain’s traffic and branding potential is really worth the price. 


7. Submit alternate / improved definition 
This feature allows other users to submit new definitions for the word. Come up with a way to display all submitted definitions and rank them based on accuracy. 


8. RFCI score - important. Add a field where we can input a score like this: “82A” or “63B” 

9. Combined summary at the top of the page which combines all the submissions of the word definition by all users. Powered by Open AI API



Submit
This is where the user can submit a new item / word. Remember, the user who submits a new word can edit the fields mentioned above.



Categories
This page is where users can filter trends / topics by categories, from the following:
Tiktok trends
New words originating via social media
Music genres
General news
Fashion Trends
New worthy inventions - closely monitored
Internet memes & content formats
+ more
A simple grid format would be great for this. 




Login / signup
In the copy here, make it clear that we only need a password + username. No email, nothing. It is a non-profit, user-maintained site, so there is no reason for us to ask for amn email etc….




Admin panel
There needs to be an admin panel where an admin can remove / add / edit topics on the site 
Edit / remove / add trends manually. If we need to add trends, we need to be able to set the popularity (how many boosts) 


Client asked me to show some my creativity and think out of the box and make this website more dynamic and more creative so i discussed with gemini and what gemini suggested is:

Here are 5 "Unconventional" creative features tailored to the client's specific vision:

1. The "Viral Velocity" Heatmap
Instead of a static list, create a homepage section called "The Heat Map."

The Feature: Words don't just sit there; they "pulse" or change color intensity based on how many people are viewing them right now.

The Tech: Use a Livewire wire:poll to update a view_count every 30 seconds. If a word gets 50+ views in 5 minutes, it glows with a "Possible Polar Trend" neon border.

Why it wins: It makes the site feel "Alive" and "Updating every second," which the client explicitly asked for.

2. "Slang-to-Sticker" Generator
TikTokers love sharing content.

The Feature: A "Share to Story" button on every card that automatically generates a beautiful, vertically-aligned image (PNG) of the word and its definition.

The Tech: Use a simple JavaScript library like html2canvas.

Why it wins: It’s free marketing. When users share these "stickers" on Instagram or TikTok, they drive traffic back to the site.

3. The "Lore" Timeline
One of your client's requirements mentioned "where you first saw it."

The Feature: A "Lore Timeline" on the word's detail page. Users can submit links to the TikTok or Tweet where the word first went viral.

The Tech: A simple sub-table linked to the Word model.

Why it wins: It turns the site into a "Historical Archive" of internet culture, making it more "Organic" and "Non-sponsored" than Urban Dictionary.

4. "Vibe-Check" Search (Fuzzy/Contextual)
Traditional search is boring.

The Feature: Allow users to search by "Vibe" or "Emotion." If someone searches for "Happy," show them slang like "Lowkey vibing" or "Main Character Energy."

The Tech: Since you are using OpenAI for summaries anyway, have the AI assign 3 "Vibe Tags" to every word upon submission.

Why it wins: It’s "Unconventional UI." It helps users find words they don't even know exist yet.

5. The "Investor" Dashboard (Domain Monetization)
Since domain selling is the monetization plan, don't hide it.

The Feature: A section for "Digital Asset Flippers." List words that are trending but have available .com domains.

The Tech: A background job that checks domain availability for the Top 10 trending words and flags them with a "💰 Investment Opportunity" badge.

Why it wins: It directly serves the business goal of the site while looking like a high-end "FinTech" tool for creators.

How to present these to the client:
Don't ask "Can I do these?" Send a "Product Strategy Update":

"Hi [Client Name], I’ve taken full creative control to optimize the UX. I am moving forward with three key 'Unconventional' features that Urban Dictionary lacks:

Viral Velocity UI: A real-time heatmap so users see 'Polar Trends' as they happen.

Slang-to-Sticker: Built-in social sharing to drive organic traffic.

The Investor Filter: A dedicated view for users to find trending words with available domains, maximizing our affiliate revenue.

These features move us from a 'Dictionary' to a 'Cultural Discovery Tool'."


******GEMINI CONCLUDED THE REQUIREMENTS IN ITS WAY*****

TikTokDictionary.com | Master Technical & Creative Blueprint
1. Project Vision & Identity
TikTokDictionary.com is a user-powered, community-driven dictionary for the 2026 social media era. Unlike Urban Dictionary, it is designed for viral speed, "Unconventional UI," and monetization through the domain name industry.

Motto: "The Go-To for Neologisms – Updated every second by the community."

Tone: High-energy, Gen-Z/Alpha native, "No Cap," organic, and 100% non-sponsored feeling.

Core User Problem: Slang changes too fast for traditional sites. Users need to verify "vibes" and meanings in real-time.

2. Fundamental Requirements (Client's Core)
Submission Engine: Users can submit words, definitions, and categories.

Hierarchical Voting: An "Agree/Disagree" system. The most "Agreed" definition is pinned to the top.

Timeframe Sorting: Homepage must sort by Now, This Week, This Month, All Time.

Admin Control: A backend panel to add/edit/remove words and manually "Boost" popularity scores.

No-Email Auth: User accounts require ONLY a Username + Password. No email collection.

3. The "Unconventional" Feature Set (Partner Strategy)
To fulfill the "Creative Control" mandate and justify the $2000 AUD budget, the following features are mandatory:

A. The "Kinetic Bento" Discovery Feed
UI Concept: Replace standard lists with a dynamic Bento Grid.

Behavior: Cards change size and color intensity based on "Viral Velocity."

Status Indicator: A pulsing green dot next to a live view counter. If views spike, add a "Possible Polar Trend" badge.

B. Monetization: The "Investor" Flow
Domain Checker: Every word card must feature a "Check Domain Availability" block.

Redirect Strategy: To avoid API rate limits, use a "Fake-Loader UX" that spins for 1.5s, then redirects the user to a pre-filled GoDaddy/Namecheap affiliate search link.

Copy Requirement: Include the specific client-provided text regarding domain branding and the GoDaddy affiliate disclaimer.

C. AI-Powered "Lore" Summary
OpenAI Integration: The top of every word detail page must feature a "Combined Community Summary" generated by AI.

Lore Timeline: Allow users to link to the original TikTok/Post where the word originated to establish "100% Organic" source proof.

D. Search-to-Submit UX
Frictionless Entry: The search bar is the hero. If a search yields no results, it morphs inline into a submission form. The user should never have to click "Go to Submit Page."

4. Technical Architecture (Laravel & Livewire)
Framework: Laravel 11 + Livewire 3 + Alpine.js.

Database Schema:

Words: title, slug, views, rfci_score, admin_boost_score.

Definitions: user_id, content, agree_count, disagree_count, is_pinned.

Votes: polymorphic (id, user_id, voteable_id, type: agree/disagree).

Categories: title, icon, slug (TikTok Trends, Memes, etc.).

Real-Time Logic: - Use wire:poll for live view counters.

Use wire:navigate for instant SPA-like page transitions.

Auth Logic: Custom Guard for username login.

5. Visual Standards (2026 UX)
Dark Mode Primary: Background #09090b (Zinc-950).

Vibrant Accents: TikTok Pink (#fe2c55) and Cyan (#25f4ee).

Typography: Bold, kinetic headers. Use "Read More" expansion for descriptions inside grid cards.

Micro-interactions: Hovering over a card should reveal the "Agree/Disagree" buttons and Domain Availability to keep the initial view clean.

6. Deliverables Checklist
[ ] Complete Homepage: Kinetic Bento Grid with live pulse effects.

[ ] Submission Flow: Integrated search-to-submit logic.

[ ] Word Detail Page: Ranking alternate definitions + AI Summary + Domain Block.

[ ] Category Grid: Filterable categories (Music, Fashion, Inventions).

[ ] Admin Dashboard: Management of trends, RFCI scores, and manual boosts.

[ ] Documentation Folder: /docs containing BACKEND_LOGIC.md, USER_FLOW.md, and MONETIZATION.md.

How to use this with the AI:
Upload this PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md file.

Give this command: "Read this blueprint carefully. I am the Technical Lead. Your job is to generate the full Laravel Livewire components and Blade views for this project. Start by generating the Database Migrations and the main Bento Grid Homepage component."

*******TECHNICAL ENGINE OF THE PROJECT********

1. The "Viral Velocity" AlgorithmTo achieve the "better than Urban Dictionary" feel, we don't just count total votes. We measure momentum. A word with 50 votes in 1 hour is "Hotter" than a word with 1000 votes from 2010.The FormulaEvery word has a trend_score calculated as:$$Score = \frac{(\text{Agrees} - \text{Disagrees}) + \text{AdminBoost}}{(\text{HoursOld} + 2)^{1.5}} \times (\text{RecentViews} \times 0.1)$$AdminBoost: A manual integer (e.g., 500) added via the dashboard to "force" a trend.HoursOld: Time since the word was created. The +2 prevents division by zero.Gravity (1.5): This power ensures that older words naturally sink unless they keep getting "RecentViews."2. Real-Time View Counting (Redis Strategy)Writing to the SQL database on every page load will crash the server if a word goes viral. We will use Redis as a buffer.The FlowThe Hit: When a user views a word, Livewire triggers Redis::incr('word_views:' . $wordId).The Pulse: The UI displays this Redis number instantly for the "Live Counter" feel.The Sync (Scheduled Task): Every 10 minutes, a Laravel Cron Job runs:It reads all keys matching word_views:*.It updates the SQL words table in one big batch.It clears the Redis keys.3. "Possible Polar Trend" LogicThe "Neon Glow" on the Bento Grid is triggered by a sudden spike in engagement.Logic: If (ViewsInLastHour > AverageHourViews * 3), the word gets the is_polar_trend flag.UI Trigger: wire:poll.10s in the Livewire component will check this flag and toggle the CSS class .animate-neon-pulse.4. Duplicate Prevention (Fuzzy Search)To handle "How do we handle many submissions of the same word?", we use Alpine.js + Livewire Listeners.Step 1: As the user types the "New Word" title, a listener pings the database.Step 2: If a match is >80% similar (e.g., "Riz" vs "Rizz"), a modal appears:"Wait! 'Rizz' already exists. Do you want to add an alternate definition instead of creating a duplicate?"Step 3: If they click Yes, it redirects to the existing word’s "Add Definition" section.5. Domain Availability Mock-FlowSince we aren't using the GoDaddy API yet, the backend will return a randomized availability for the UI demo:PHPpublic function checkDomain($word) {
    // Simulated Logic for Milestone 1
    $this->availability = (strlen($word) > 4) ? 'available' : 'taken';
    $this->price = '$12.99';
}
6. Admin Panel RequirementsThe Filament/Admin dashboard must include:The Boost Slider: A UI slider from 1 to 1000 to instantly rank a word.The RFCI Input: A text field to assign the trend "Grade" (e.g., 88A).Definition Approval: A toggle to "Verify" a user-submitted definition, giving it a checkmark badge.Final Instruction for the AI Developer:"When building the TrendingService.php class, implement the math formula above. Use Laravel's Cache::remember for the homepage query to ensure the Bento Grid loads in under 200ms, even with 10,000+ words in the database."

*******NEW FEATURES********

Livewire 3 + Puter.js Audio Integration
1. Global Setup
In your main layout file (app.blade.php), add the Puter.js script tag before @livewireScripts.

HTML

<script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>
@livewireScripts
2. The Word Card Component (Blade)
In your Livewire component view (e.g., livewire/word-card.blade.php), use Alpine.js to handle the audio logic. This ensures the "Play" button works instantly without a server round-trip.

HTML

<div x-data="{ 
    playing: false,
    async playAudio(text) {
        this.playing = true;
        try {
            // Neural AI Voice through Puter.js
            const audio = await puter.ai.txt2speech(text, {
                voice: 'nova', // The trendy TikTok 'Bestie' voice
                speed: 1.1    // Slightly faster for social media vibe
            });
            
            audio.onended = () => { this.playing = false; };
            audio.play();
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Audio failed:', error);
            this.playing = false;
        }
    }
}">
    <button 
        @click="playAudio('{{ $word->title }}: {{ $word->definition }}')"
        :class="playing ? 'bg-pink-500 animate-pulse' : 'bg-zinc-800'"
        class="flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-bold transition"
    >
        <span x-show="!playing">🔊 Listen</span>
        <span x-show="playing">🔈 Playing...</span>
    </button>
</div>
3. Advanced Feature: "Sound-Bite" Download
To allow creators to use the audio on TikTok, add this function to your Alpine x-data:

JavaScript

async downloadAudio(text, filename) {
    const audio = await puter.ai.txt2speech(text);
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = audio.src;
    link.download = `${filename}-definition.mp3`;
    link.click();
}
