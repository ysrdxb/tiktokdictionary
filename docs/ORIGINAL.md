tiktokdictionary.com 
Aim: 
To make a site with the same purpose and functionality as Urban Dictionary, but better! You need to think about what features to add which would make the tiktok dictionary better, and add them to your design. 
Tiktokdictionary.com is a user-powered dictionary, similar to Urbandictionary.com - but more suited towards tiktokers and social media creators.
The aim of tiktokdictionary.com is to be a non-sponsored, 100% organic source of new words and topics that originate from social media and niche communities like tiktok and forums. .
It works by allowing users to submit a word they saw on social media, then other users ‘agree / disagree’ with the definitions written by the user who submitted.
Similar to urban dictionaries, other users will be able to provide alternate definitions to the same words. Other users will also be able to agree / disagree with these definitions. The UI will need to present the most ‘agreed’ definition as a priority to the user rather than the definitions with lesser ‘agrees’ and more ‘disagrees’
Words that have high contributions and agree / disagree should rank higher on the homepage, which other users can sort based on timeframe (trending now, this week, this month etc….)

Upload these words to the CMS

Fundamental / core functionality (how the site will look / work):
The ultimate goal, as mentioned above, is to have a simple site where users can submit word definitions, and other users can easily navigate those submitted definitions, similar to an urban dictionary.

That’s it! 

When designing the UI / Functionality, think about the sort of problems that users would face, given that the platform content is produced by the users themselves. Make sure to design the site in a way where we can work around such issues. For example, how will we handle many user submissions of the same word?

Essential Requiremtns: 
The layout and UI of the site must be completely new and unique. Don’t copy existing sites like urbandictionary. Come up with creative new features that existing dictionary sites don’t have.
I have only provided the fundamental idea behind the site. You will need to get creative and come up with unique features that make the platform even better than current competitors. Think outside of the box to address issues that future users may come across. 


Initial Probationary Milestone:
This is the budget, deadline and deliverables  we’re setting aside for the initial phase of the project, so that we can ‘test the waters’ with you first before long-term commitment. Think of this as a trial period. If the agreed work can’t be completed within this budget, we’ll need to end the partnership. 
Amount: $400 AUD
Deadline: 2nd Oct 2025
Deliverables: UI complete for the homepage + idea on how the backend will work. 
Hard parts of this project / What we’re looking for in the delivery of the initial milestone
Un-conventional UI and layout design - this is important! Think outside of the box to design a unique, one of a kind UI that is not currently seen on existing software that has similar purpose / functionality.
Creative copy where needed - ability to write unique copy without the assistance of ChatGPT. 
Fast and clean delivery
Working backend concept (does not yet need to be built) for the trend discovery system itself.



Home
The Home Page is the central hub where users can explore all submitted dictionary words / jargon and add new ones.
It must feel community-driven, intuitive, and visually engaging, like a mix between Exploding Topics and a social discovery board.
Let users:
Browse words submitted by others
Sort words (by popularity, timeframe, or niche)
Submit their own new word directly from the same page
Search for a word using the search bar at the top
Filter words based on trends and ‘soon to be trends’ 

Requirements:
From this home page, it should also be extremely easy for the user to submit a new word.
Above the fold, put the search bar where the user can search for a word. See the user flow here to understand what happens if the word is on the site already or not.

The TikTok Dictionary - Learn And Submit New Words You Hear On Tiktok & Other Platforms

New words are being created and used every day by niche communities both online and in real life. The goal of TikTokDictionary is to be the go-to dictionary for neologisms - updating every second by the community. 

How it works
Submit a new word you come across on social media, along with its definition and where you first saw it
Submit alternate / improved definitions
Agree / disagree with definitions submitted by other users.


Word / Item
Each definition shown on the site’s homepage should display the following fields inside its card/div block:
1. Word Title
Large and bold — the main clickable text.
Clicking should open the trend’s detail page.

2. -  Live view counter + ‘trending indicator’ - if the word has many views, write ‘possible polar trend’ somewhere next to the live view counter. Indicate that it is live with a green dot animation. 

3. Description
Short summary of what the word is about.
Keep text truncation (e.g., max 2–3 lines) with “Read more” expansion.

4. Agree button 
This is the button the users click when they agree the word definition / if it is correct. You also need to include a popularity indicator to show words that have a high amount of likes over a period of time. 

5. Category
Example categories: Tech, Fashion, Slang, Product, Meme, etc.
Shown as a small colored tag or pill near the top or bottom of the card.

6. Domain name availability
The purpose of this section is to show the user whether the domain name for the particular word is available for purchase or not. This is how the site will be monetised. 
Copy for this section:
Get the ‘Word here’ Domain Name For Your Business
Using a short, single-word domain name for your brand comes with major advantages, such as:
Built-in traffic: Real words often match high-volume search terms, helping your site attract organic visitors more easily via SEO.


Instant credibility: A clean, dictionary-style domain makes your brand look established, trustworthy, and memorable.


Stronger branding: One-word domains are simple to remember, easy to share, and stand out across social media and ads.


Long-term value: These domains are digital assets that can appreciate in value over time — many sell for thousands or even millions.


Is this really a good financial decision? Before deciding to buy this domain, research it properly using third party tools like Semrush, EarlyAdoption, or any other reliable traffic analysis software. 

AFFILIATE DISCLAIMER - IMPORTANT:
Tiktok dictionary remains completely FREE to use and free of any banner advertising thanks to referral commissions from Godaddy. 
This means we will receive a small commission from godaddy if you decide to purchase any domain name from their platform. 
That being said, we never exaggerate or manipulate traffic data just to encourage a purchase through GoDaddy. Please make sure to do your own research about the word using Semrush, EarlyAdoption or other third party traffic checking tools, to help you decide whether or not the domain’s traffic and branding potential is really worth the price. 


7. Submit alternate / improved definition 
This feature allows other users to submit new definitions for the word. Come up with a way to display all submitted definitions and rank them based on accuracy. 


8. RFCI score - important. Add a field where we can input a score like this: “82A” or “63B” 

9. Combined summary at the top of the page which combines all the submissions of the word definition by all users. Powered by Open AI API



Submit
This is where the user can submit a new item / word. Remember, the user who submits a new word can edit the fields mentioned above.



Categories
This page is where users can filter trends / topics by categories, from the following:
Tiktok trends
New words originating via social media
Music genres
General news
Fashion Trends
New worthy inventions - closely monitored
Internet memes & content formats
+ more
A simple grid format would be great for this. 




Login / signup
In the copy here, make it clear that we only need a password + username. No email, nothing. It is a non-profit, user-maintained site, so there is no reason for us to ask for amn email etc….




Admin panel
There needs to be an admin panel where an admin can remove / add / edit topics on the site 
Edit / remove / add trends manually. If we need to add trends, we need to be able to set the popularity (how many boosts)
